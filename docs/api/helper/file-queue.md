# file-queue

The `file-queue` helper is one of the core primitives of ember-file-upload.

If a named queue is not found, it will be created for you.

```hbs
{{#let (file-queue name='photos') as |queue|}}
  {{queue.progress}}%
{{/let}}
```

If a name is not provided, the default queue will be used.

```hbs
{{#let (file-queue) as |queue|}}
  {{queue.progress}}%
{{/let}}
```
