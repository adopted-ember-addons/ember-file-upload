# Getting started

Ember FileUpload is an ember addon that makes uploading files easy.

Uploads continue in the background, even after a page transition. In other words they are persistent across routes in your application.

To use the uploader, you must provide a name (for proper queueing and bundling of resources), and an upload URL.

## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-file-upload
```
