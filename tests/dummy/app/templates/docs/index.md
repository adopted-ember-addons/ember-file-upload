# Getting started

`{{file-upload}}` is an ember component that provides an API for file uploads. Uploads are persistent across routes in your application (they continue in the background).

To use the uploader, you must provide a name (for proper queueing and bundling of resources), and an upload URL.

## Installation

```sh
ember install ember-file-upload
```
